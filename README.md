# 🏥 Predictors of Health in US Counties

This repository contains an **R project** analyzing health outcomes across **U.S. counties**,  
based on various predictors from the **2018 County Health Rankings Data (v2.xls)**.  

The analysis applies **machine learning techniques** to explore the relationships between predictors and health indicators,  
and generates a range of **visualizations and prediction plots**.
